I think of this as in a two lanes road that must turn right, but only the curb lane can turn on red. Meaning that only one car can turn at a time on a red light. That's what single threaded means.

          <script type="text/template">
          ## Syncronous Script
          ```
            fileObject = open(file);
            # after we WAITED for the file to open, we can write to it

            fileObject.write('We are writing to the file!');

        <section data-markdown data-notes="What is a callback? a callback is a function that is passed as an argument to another function and is invoked after some kind of event. Once the parent function completes the function passed as an argument is then called. Callbacks are most used when code needs to be run asynchronously. Meaning that the order in which these are executed isn't predicted. Which is the case of Events and AJAX requests. (AJAX stands for Asynchronous JavaScript and XML. In short, it is the use of the XMLHttpRequest object to communicate with server-side scripts. It can send as well as receive information in a variety of formats, including JSON, XML, HTML, and even text files.). We can't know how long the server will take to respond with to respond or when the users will click a button and bring up other events, much less know which order they'll do it. So we use callbacks to essensially say: 'When this asynchronous operation completes, do X, where X is the code in your callback function'. In this example, we have a button component, we add an event listener 'Onclick to it', even though we don't pass the handleViewMoreClick function in the parameter, this is still considered as a callback">

          <Button

            onClick={ () => this.handleViewMoreClick() }

				<section data-markdown data-notes="As we expected this all led us to Promises. and promises is all about asynchronous computations.. As you can see we did not instantiate our promise with 'new Promise' class, the 'then' method in this case is sufficient to tell our method that we are expecting a promise. Basically a Promise is a placeholder object that represents the result of an async operation. This object will hold the info about the status of the async operation and will notify us when the async operation succeds or fails. We could have added another method there called catch for error handling.">
